# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This Python project implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user can play against the computer. The game provides a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

## Features
User Input: Prompt the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
Computer Selection: Randomly generates a choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
Game Logic: Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. (Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.)
Display Result: Shows the user's choice and the computer's choice, along with the game result (win, lose, or tie).
Score Tracking (Optional): Keeps track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
Play Again: Asks the user if they want to play another round.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.

## Gameplay
Upon running the main.py file, the user will be prompted to choose between rock, paper, scissors, or to exit the game:

(1) Rock
(2) Paper
(3) Scissors
(4) Exit
Simply follow the on-screen instructions to select your choice and play the game. After each round, the game will display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the current score.

## Scoring
The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores throughout multiple rounds. The winner is determined based on the highest score at the end of the game.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
Thanks to the Python community for their valuable resources and tutorials on creating command-line games.
